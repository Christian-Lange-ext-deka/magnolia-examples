== trip - collection of tours

I want to collect multiple tours in a trip.
Create a rest-Endpoint to only get trip-tour-infos without large images

[source,bash]

cp -r ../from_git/basic-headless-demos/magnolia magnolia
cd magnolia
mgnl jumpstart
# 2

# Now, pick up some handy configuration and sample images.
cp -r ../../from_git/basic-headless-demos/magnolia/_dev/content-to-bootstrap/* ./apache-tomcat/webapps/magnoliaAuthor/WEB-INF/bootstrap/common

mgnl start

* Add Trip with multiple tours
* define rest endpoint that is only providing metadata no binary images
* seems to just work... -> try link:trips.http[] and look for images (only JCRs are provided)
